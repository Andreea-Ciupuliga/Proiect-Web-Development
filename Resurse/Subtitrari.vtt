00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.700 line:0 align:middle
So how do we navigate blender this may seem <i>intimidating</i>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.900 line:0 align:middle
at first but it's actually pretty <i>simple</i>.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.200 line:0 align:middle
Let's start with the 3D viewport.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000 line:0 align:middle
The first thing you'll be curious about is how to select

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.600
things simply left.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.900
Click any object to select it and left click empty space

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.700
to deselect.

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.700
You can also press a to select all and ALT a to deselect

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.200
all some users may be interested in right-click select. which

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
is arguably better for your health.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.600
So we made a separate video about that if you are curious

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.000
the next thing you want to To learn is the basics of navigation

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.100
how to rotate how to pan and how to zoom your perspective

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100
of the viewport to do that.

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400
All you need are these buttons right here.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
So let's say we want to rotate around our Cube.

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.000
Luckily.

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.200
We have a very handy Gizmo in the top right of our viewport

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.400
that looks like this notice how it responds to our cursor

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.000
floating above each axis.

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.400
Go ahead and hover over the blue z-axis indicator and the

22
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.000
left click you'll notice that it brings you directly into

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800
what's called top orthographic.

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.400
You this can be done for any axis to snap to its corresponding

25
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.700
perspective. However. if you instead click and drag the same

26
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.100
Gizmo. you'll find a much more flexible way of rotating your

27
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.300
view of the world.

28
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.700
It's important for some to know that you can also middle

29
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
click drag to achieve the same effect. but from any cursor

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
position now. you'll notice that our view seems to Pivot

31
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
around a particular point in the viewport that being the

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.400
center or origin of our grid this also happens to be where

33
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.000
our cube is at the moment.

34
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.700
However. what if we Didn't want to look at the cube.

35
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.800
What if we wanted to look over here or something?

36
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.100
Well now all you have to do is click this hand icon and drag

37
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.800
to where you want to have centered from there.

38
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.100
You'll notice your pivot has changed when you rotate your

39
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.700
perspective for hotkey users simply hold shift and middle

40
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Mouse drag to achieve the same effect. but from any cursor

41
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.300
position. but let's say I want to focus back on my Cube again.

42
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.400
How do we do that?

43
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
Well for that I want to quickly show you the frame selected

44
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.700
tool which can be found under View.

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.100
This will reframe your perspective to focus on the object

46
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.700
or objects.

47
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.800
You have selected.

48
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100
This can also be achieved by using the period key on a number

49
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.000
pad now that we're this close to our Cube.

50
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300
You may be asking how do we zoom in and out but it's pretty

51
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.500
self-explanatory. We have a magnifying glass here click and

52
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.800
drag it to zoom in and out or you can use the scroll wheel

53
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
or plus and minus keys on the numpad to accomplish the same

54
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.300
task. And that's basically it for the basics of navigation.

55
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.000
But you may have noticed that we haven't used the other two

56
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.700
buttons in this area the camera icon and the grid icon the

57
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000
camera icon will bring you into the eyes of your camera.

58
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200
This is very helpful for setting up camera angles and previewing

59
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.400
what will eventually be your output image alternatively.

60
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.100
You can also use zero on the number pad.

61
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.200
The fourth button here is a grid this may confuse you at

62
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.900
first but this switch is your viewport between orthographic

63
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.700
mode and perspective mode.

64
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.100
I want ahead and set up a scene here to make it more obvious

65
00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.500
to you.

66
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.600
But you may be asking what's the difference between these

67
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.300
two modes?

68
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.000
Well perspective mode is a realistic view of the 3D objects

69
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.200
in your scene. which takes into account how far away objects

70
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.500
are from you into how it displays the object the further

71
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.100
away. Something is the smaller it gets visually however orthographic

72
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.100
mode. URS all of that and flattens your world so that no

73
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.700
perspective is seen everything is angle perfect.

74
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
This is an unrealistic view but helps immensely with making

75
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.300
models accurate. especially in relation to say a 2d concept

76
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.000
sketch but that's just the viewport in the next video.

77
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.900
I'll be talking about all the different windows.

78
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.800
We see here what they do and how to navigate them as well.
